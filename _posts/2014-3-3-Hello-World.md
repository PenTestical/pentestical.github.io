title: Misguided Ghosts - Writeup

Today we'll go through the Tryhackme lab "Misguided Ghosts". In this writeup, I want to show you my methodology rather than just a solution for this box. I had quite a lot of fun with this room! Thanks to @bobloblaw#92281 and @jakeyee#3919 for creating it.

Information Gathering
Port scanning with nmap
The first step is, as always, to start with a port scan. Let's start with a light scan for the 1000 most common ports:
nmap -T4 - max-retries 1  - max-scan-delay 20  - defeat-rst-ratelimit  -open

Figure 1: Light nmap scan showing up two open ports, FTP and SSH.As we can observe, we have two open ports. SSH on port 22 and FTP on port 21. We could assume at this point, that the host is running Linux. But let's confirm this by a full nmap scan.
